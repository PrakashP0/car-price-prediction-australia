# 🚗 Car Price Prediction Australia

A machine learning project to predict used car prices in Australia based on specifications like brand, engine size, and vehicle length.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build predictive models for estimating car prices using regression techniques and identify the most accurate algorithm.

---

## 📊 Models Used

- Linear Regression  
- Ridge Regression  
- Polynomial Regression  
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost

---

## 🏆 Best Model
